The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jan 23, Sunday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1: Jan 23, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with two numbers sum. I spend time in AlgoExpert to find solution with sum numbers with targetsum. You need to check out and write function take non empty array of distinct integer represensting a target sum. Start learning System Design Path only Introduction and what is the system design.

**Thoughts**: I think I feel good about starting my path for 100 days code chalenge. Sometimes you need motivation to start your journey, I am glad that I am starting.
