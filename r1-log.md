## Log

### R1D1: Jan 23, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with two numbers sum. I spend time in AlgoExpert to find solution with sum numbers with targetsum. You need to check out and write function take non empty array of distinct integer represensting a target sum. Start learning System Design Path only Introduction and what is the system design.

**Thoughts**: I think I feel good about starting my path for 100 days code chalenge. Sometimes you need motivation to start your journey, I am glad that I am starting.

### R1D2: Jan 24, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with Validate Subsequense Algoritm. You need to write function that determines the second array is a subsequense of the first one. Actually and continue passing System Design this was Client Server Model.

**Thoughts**: I just for starting I see that I can code myself and doing much do understand the basic DS and Algoritms, but sometimes you can see you need extra help the video explanation.
