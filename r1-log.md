# #100DaysOfCode Log - [Ismoil Shifoev]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jan 23, Sunday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1: Jan 23, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with two numbers sum. I spend time in AlgoExpert to find solution with sum numbers with targetsum. You need to check out and write function take non empty array of distinct integer represensting a target sum. Start learning System Design Path only Introduction and what is the system design.

**Thoughts**: I think I feel good about starting my path for 100 days code chalenge. Sometimes you need motivation to start your journey, I am glad that I am starting.

### R1D2: Jan 24, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with Validate Subsequense Algoritm. You need to write function that determines the second array is a subsequense of the first one. Actually and continue passing System Design this was Client Server Model.

**Thoughts**: I just for starting I see that I can code myself and doing much do understand the basic DS and Algoritms, but sometimes you can see you need extra help the video explanation.

### R1D3: Jan 25. 2022

**Today Progress**: Working with Sorted Square Array Algoritm. Write functions that takes is a not-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and return new array of the same length with squares. Continue passing System Design topic Network protocol only some part of it.

**Thoughts**: Yeah I feel good that sometimes I would like to finish my work myself and it is give me proud for me. But sometimes for example I would like to dedicate more time to finish something, but I can't because I have another work need to do.

### R1D4 Jan 26, 2022

**Today Progress** Working with Tournament Winner Algoritm and DS. There is the algoritm tournament place in which 
teams programmers complete against each other. Only two teams complete against each other in time, one team home team and one away. Continue working with System Design Network Protocols very interesting topic.

**Thoughts** : I think this day more very complicated DS and Algoritms and I will continue working the problem give us more length to work.

### R1D5 Jan 27, 2022

**Today progress** Working with NON-Construcrible change. Given an array of positive integers representing on the values of the coins in your possession, write function that the minimum amount of change(the minimum sum of money), that you can't create. Continue learning System Design Section Storage

**Thoughts** : I think this day more very complicated DS and Algoritms and I will continue working the problem give us more length to work.

### R1D6 Jan 28, 2022

**Today progress** Working with BST Data Structure. Write function that takes in Binary Search Tree(BST) and a target integer value and return the closest value to the target value contained in the BST. Continue exploring topic System Desing like Latency and Throghput.

**Thoughts** I think when I am going and exploring new DS and Algoritms it is become difficulty to understand, but I think it will take time to understand more things very clear. The same thing about System Design.
