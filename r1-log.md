## Log

### R1D1: Jan 23, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with two numbers sum. I spend time in AlgoExpert to find solution with sum numbers with targetsum. You need to check out and write function take non empty array of distinct integer represensting a target sum. Start learning System Design Path only Introduction and what is the system design.

**Thoughts**: I think I feel good about starting my path for 100 days code chalenge. Sometimes you need motivation to start your journey, I am glad that I am starting.

### R1D2: Jan 24, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with Validate Subsequense Algoritm. You need to write function that determines the second array is a subsequense of the first one. Actually and continue passing System Design this was Client Server Model.

**Thoughts**: I just for starting I see that I can code myself and doing much do understand the basic DS and Algoritms, but sometimes you can see you need extra help the video explanation.

### R1D3: Jan 25. 2022
**Today Progress**: Working with Sorted Square Array Algoritm. Write functions that takes is a not-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and return new array of the same length with squares. Continue passing System Design topic Network protocol only some part of it.

**Thoughts**: Yeah I feel good that sometimes I would like to finish my work myself and it is give me proud for me. But sometimes for example I would like to dedicate more time to finish something, but I can't because I have another work need to do.
