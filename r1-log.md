# #100DaysOfCode Log - [Ismoil Shifoev]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jan 23, Sunday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1: Jan 23, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with two numbers sum. I spend time in AlgoExpert to find solution with sum numbers with targetsum. You need to check out and write function take non empty array of distinct integer represensting a target sum. Start learning System Design Path only Introduction and what is the system design.

**Thoughts**: I think I feel good about starting my path for 100 days code chalenge. Sometimes you need motivation to start your journey, I am glad that I am starting.

### R1D2: Jan 24, 2022

**Todays Progress**: Working with Validate Subsequense Algoritm. You need to write function that determines the second array is a subsequense of the first one. Actually and continue passing System Design this was Client Server Model.

**Thoughts**: I just for starting I see that I can code myself and doing much do understand the basic DS and Algoritms, but sometimes you can see you need extra help the video explanation.

### R1D3: Jan 25. 2022

**Today Progress**: Working with Sorted Square Array Algoritm. Write functions that takes is a not-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and return new array of the same length with squares. Continue passing System Design topic Network protocol only some part of it.

**Thoughts**: Yeah I feel good that sometimes I would like to finish my work myself and it is give me proud for me. But sometimes for example I would like to dedicate more time to finish something, but I can't because I have another work need to do.

### R1D4 Jan 26, 2022

**Today Progress** Working with Tournament Winner Algoritm and DS. There is the algoritm tournament place in which 
teams programmers complete against each other. Only two teams complete against each other in time, one team home team and one away. Continue working with System Design Network Protocols very interesting topic.

**Thoughts** : I think this day more very complicated DS and Algoritms and I will continue working the problem give us more length to work.

### R1D5 Jan 27, 2022

**Today progress** Working with NON-Construcrible change. Given an array of positive integers representing on the values of the coins in your possession, write function that the minimum amount of change(the minimum sum of money), that you can't create. Continue learning System Design Section Storage

**Thoughts** : I think this day more very complicated DS and Algoritms and I will continue working the problem give us more length to work.

### R1D6 Jan 28, 2022

**Today progress** Working with BST Data Structure. Write function that takes in Binary Search Tree(BST) and a target integer value and return the closest value to the target value contained in the BST. Continue exploring topic System Desing like Latency and Throghput.

**Thoughts** I think when I am going and exploring new DS and Algoritms it is become difficulty to understand, but I think it will take time to understand more things very clear. The same thing about System Design.

### R1D7 Jan 29, 2022

**Today progress** Working with Branch Sums DS Binary Tree. Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and return a list of it's branch sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to rightmost branch sum. System Design topic Availiablity start, but not finish yet.

**Thoughts** Some times I think I have a progress in my work, but sometimes I see that it is not easily integrates such DS like a Binary Tree. But feel good that I am not give up and each day I am working in my progression.

### R1D8 Jan 30, 2022

**Today Progress** Working with Nodes Depth DS Binary Tree. Write function that takes Binary Tree and return the sum of it's nodes depths. System Design to see the Availability part like SLA and SLO how your server can be availiable very interesting topic. 

**Thoughts** Mostly I am getting what I am doing, but topic binary tree need more time to understand very efficient for prepare for interview. But feel good, I think I have a progress.

### R1D9 Jan 31, 2022

**Today Progress** Working with Depth First Search. You are give a nodes class that has a name and an array of optional children nodes. When puts together, from as asyclic tree-like structure. System Design starting Cache topic, but not end yet.

**Thoughts** Very interesting part and understandable. I think I am working in right side. Feel good mostly.

### R1D10 Feb 01, 2022

**Today Progress** Working with Minimum waiting time. You are give an non empty array of positive integers representing an amount of time that specific queries take to execute. Only one query can be excecuted at a time, but the queries can't be executed in any order. System Design Topic Cache very interesting part for the Youtube Design.

**Thoghts** I am feeling good, that have understand things for exexution time algoritm and caching topic for big system will be. But need to continue working never give up Ismoil.

### R1D11 Feb 02, 2022

**Today progress** Working with class photos. It is photo day at local school, and you are photographer assigned to take class photos. You are given two input arrays one containing  height of all students with red shirt another one will contain with blue shirt. System Design start Reverse Topic, but not finish yet.

**Thoghts** When you are go deeper you understand something you need to take more time to get. But, no matter we can handle this very interesting topics greedy algoritm and reverse proxy
